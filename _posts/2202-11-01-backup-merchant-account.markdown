Disaster can strike when you least expect it. Every responsibile business owner knows how important it is to be prepared for the unexpected, especially when it comes to your operational systems. Is your business dependent on credit and debit card payments to survive? If you answered yes to this question, having a backup merchant account is of the utmost importance. It pays to be prepared.

## Why bother with a backup merchant account?

Your business cannot afford the risk of losing the ability to process electronic payments for any period of time. Industries considered high-risk in terms of credit card processing are even more vulnerable. Banks can close business accounts for a variety of reasons. Many of these reasons are beyond the company's control.

Imagine this scenario for a moment – ​​you're at a travel agency and you're planning a fantastic vacation. After spending a reasonable amount of time going through the details, it's finally time to officially book your tour. The travel agent informs you that their credit card system is down and they can only accept payment by cash or paper check. You planned to pay by credit card. You don't have cash on hand, which means a paper check is out of the question. This very annoying and frustrating situation. Do you completely abandon your plans and go to another travel agency?

This situation puts you in a vulnerable position, and that is not good for the travel agency. The chances of the client ever doing business with you again are low. Fortunately, this is a completely preventable situation.

## Ensure you don't lose business

The bottom line is that losing the ability to process credit and debit cards puts customers right into the hands of your competition.
