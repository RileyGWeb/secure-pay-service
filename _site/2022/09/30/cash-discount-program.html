<p>It’s no secret that inflation has had a negative impact on all of us. It’s basic economics. The cost of goods 
has increased and business profits have declined. Whatever your profit margin was a couple of years ago 
has gone down. Down as your cost has increased. We want to show you how we can instantly start 
recouping some of those profits immediately. A bill was passed called the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform 
Act, opening up a way to offset up to 100% of those processing fees you’re paying to accept your 
customers money, inflation included. The more inflation increases store prices, the more fees you pay. 
Every month, businesses are throwing away profits in the form of percentages, transaction fees, batch 
fees, and a laundry list of monthly fees, such as statement fees, PCI fees and more, just to accept credit 
cards. And don’t forget those annual fees too. Across America, businesses are taking advantage of the 
law. But many small business owners don’t even know about this option. Here’s how. Have you ever been 
to a gas station where they offer a cash price and credit price per gallon? That’s the best example of the 
business utilizing this law.</p>

<p>We as consumers are getting a discount if we pay by cash. And if we choose to use our card, we don’t 
get the cash discounted price. In essence, the gas stations are offsetting their processing fees by doing 
this. It’s called the Cash Discount program. And right now more than ever, businesses everywhere are 
taking advantage of the same law and implementing the cash discount program in order to eliminate their 
fees too. It’s so simple. There are no annual fees, no PCI fees, no junk fees, percentages, or even 
transaction fees. You simply pay one monthly fee and that’s it. If you process less than $5,000, you only 
pay $25. If you process between five and $10,000, you only pay $50 a month. And if you process any 
amount over $10,000 a month, then you only pay a flat $100. That’s it. You can literally process 50,000, 
$100,000 or more. And the highest monthly fee we charge is only $100. There are no contracts, no 
purchases are required, and no gimmicks. Just one flat monthly fee for the life of your business. But this 
is just an animated video explaining it. So here is some feedback from real customers that implemented 
EasyPay’s Cash Discount Program.</p>

<p>It was exactly what I was told it was going to be.</p>

<p>It’s been exactly what I’ve been told.</p>

<p>I love the program. It’s exactly as I was told. We’re saving, on average, $25 to $3,500 a month.</p>

<p>It saved me a lot of money.</p>

<p>It’s gone from two to month basis. I would guess it would probably save five to $6,000.</p>

<p>Saving $30,000. I’m very happy.</p>

<p>It’s so easy. It is literally easy to keep a.</p>

<p>Small business thriving as much as possible. This is one of the best things that a small business can do.</p>

<p>If you’re on the fence and you’re not sure, try it for months, try it for a month, and no harm, no foul. If it 
works, then you’re literally saving yourself thousands. If it doesn’t, then just stop using it.</p>

<p>Anyone that owns a business that takes credit card definitely I’m recommending it to them. It’s definitely 
going to save them a lot of money.</p>

<p>I would totally recommend ECT.</p>

<p>We are so confident you’ll never switch merchant service providers again that we are going to give you a 
free credit card terminal and we will never require you to sign any long term contracts. Join the movement 
to recoup lost profits starting today by saying goodbye to your credit card fees forever. Thanks in advance 
for your business and we promise to provide nothing less than white glove service the whole process 
through. Welcome to EasyPay and goodbye to your profit killing credit card fees.</p>
