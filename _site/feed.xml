<p>There was a major Visa/Mastercard rate hike that affected restaurants, bars, cafes, retail, services etc. In response, a class-action suit was filed against the major card brands and settlement payouts are available to all the merchants affected…</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of the lawsiut, courtesy of <a href="https://www.natso.com/topics/guidance-on-visa-mastercard-swipe-fee-class-action-settlement">natso.com:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Federal Court has preliminarily approved a proposed settlement of a maximum of approximately $6.24 billion and a minimum of at least $5.54 billion in a class action lawsuit, called In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, MDL 1720 (MKB) (JO). The lawsuit is about claims that merchants paid excessive fees to accept Visa and Mastercard cards because Visa and Mastercard, individually, and together with their respective member banks, violated the antitrust laws. A number of NATSO members who may be a part of this class have sought guidance as to how this process will proceed and what steps they should take as part of this process. 
<br /> <br /></p>

  <p>Following preliminary approval, merchants will receive official notice of the settlement and will need to decide whether they want to:  (1) receive funds from the class settlement; (2) opt out of the settlement completely; or (3) object to the terms of the settlement in order to try to convince the court to reject it.  Each option has its own pros and cons, and merchants may want to consult with their own counsel before making any final decisions. Although all companies should consult counsel before proceeding, as a general matter companies that do not plan to file their own independent lawsuit going forward have decided that it makes the most sense to accept the settlement money associated with this litigation.</p>

<p><strong>If you have Accepted Visa or Mastercard since 2004, you may be getting ripped off without even knowing it.</strong></p>

It was created by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standards were first introduced in 2004 and they have been updated several times since then.</p>

<p>The standards are designed to protect credit card information from being stolen by hackers. They are also designed to ensure that credit card information is not accidentally leaked by businesses.</p>

<p>The standards cover several different areas including:</p>

<ul class="checked-list">
  <li>Network security: This includes firewalls, encryption, and network segmentation.</li>
  <li>Access control: This includes password protection and multifactor authentication.</li>
  <li>Application security: This includes secure coding practices and vulnerability management.</li>
  <li>Physical security: This includes the use of locks, cameras, and alarm systems.</li>
  <li>Business continuity: This includes disaster recovery plans and backup systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance with the standards is voluntary, but it is highly recommended by the PCI Security Standards Council. It is also required by most major credit card companies.</p>

<p>If you fail to comply with the standards, you could be fined or even lose your ability to accept credit cards.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-responsible-for-pci-compliance">Who is responsible for pci compliance?</h4>

<p>Merchants and service providers that process credit card payments are required to comply with these standards.</p>

<p>Merchants and service providers that process credit card payments are not required to comply with PCI compliance if they have less than 10,000 transactions per year.</p>

<h4 id="who-enforces-pci-compliance">Who enforces pci compliance?</h4>

<p>PCI compliance was created by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.</p>

<p>The council was formed in 2006 by the major credit card companies, including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc.</p>

<p>The council’s goal is to reduce credit card fraud by creating a set of security standards for merchants and service providers that process credit card payments.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pci-compliance">How long does it take to get PCI compliance?</h4>

<p>From start to finish, the process of becoming PCI compliant typically takes between a day and two weeks. The actual time for compliance will be dependent on how long the self-assessment questionnaire takes to complete.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-you-get-a-pci-compliance-certificate">How do you get a PCI compliance certificate?</h4>

<p>Step 1: Identify all of the payment card information that is stored on your company’s computers. This includes credit card numbers, credit card security codes, and credit card expiration dates.</p>

<p>Step 2: Determine if your company’s computers are secure from hackers and other threats.</p>

<p>Step 3: If your company’s computers are not secure from hackers and other threats, make sure that they are secure before the next step is taken.</p>

<p>Step 4: Make sure that all of your employees are aware of the rules and regulations of the payment card industry.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[PCI compliance is a set of security standards that are used to protect credit card information.
