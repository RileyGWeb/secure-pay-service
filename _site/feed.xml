<p>It’s no secret that inflation has had a negative impact on all of us. It’s basic economics. The cost of goods 
has increased and business profits have declined. Whatever your profit margin was a couple of years ago 
has gone down. Down as your cost has increased. We want to show you how we can instantly start 
recouping some of those profits immediately. A bill was passed called the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform 
Act, opening up a way to offset up to 100% of those processing fees you’re paying to accept your 
customers money, inflation included. The more inflation increases store prices, the more fees you pay. 
Every month, businesses are throwing away profits in the form of percentages, transaction fees, batch 
fees, and a laundry list of monthly fees, such as statement fees, PCI fees and more, just to accept credit 
cards. And don’t forget those annual fees too. Across America, businesses are taking advantage of the 
law. But many small business owners don’t even know about this option. Here’s how. Have you ever been 
to a gas station where they offer a cash price and credit price per gallon? That’s the best example of the 
business utilizing this law.</p>

<p>We as consumers are getting a discount if we pay by cash. And if we choose to use our card, we don’t 
get the cash discounted price. In essence, the gas stations are offsetting their processing fees by doing 
this. It’s called the Cash Discount program. And right now more than ever, businesses everywhere are 
taking advantage of the same law and implementing the cash discount program in order to eliminate their 
fees too. It’s so simple. There are no annual fees, no PCI fees, no junk fees, percentages, or even 
transaction fees. You simply pay one monthly fee and that’s it. If you process less than $5,000, you only 
pay $25. If you process between five and $10,000, you only pay $50 a month. And if you process any 
amount over $10,000 a month, then you only pay a flat $100. That’s it. You can literally process 50,000, 
$100,000 or more. And the highest monthly fee we charge is only $100. There are no contracts, no 
purchases are required, and no gimmicks. Just one flat monthly fee for the life of your business. But this 
is just an animated video explaining it. So here is some feedback from real customers that implemented 
EasyPay’s Cash Discount Program.</p>

<p>It was exactly what I was told it was going to be.</p>

<p>It’s been exactly what I’ve been told.</p>

<p>I love the program. It’s exactly as I was told. We’re saving, on average, $25 to $3,500 a month.</p>

<p>It saved me a lot of money.</p>

<p>It’s gone from two to month basis. I would guess it would probably save five to $6,000.</p>

<p>Saving $30,000. I’m very happy.</p>

<p>It’s so easy. It is literally easy to keep a.</p>

<p>Small business thriving as much as possible. This is one of the best things that a small business can do.</p>

<p>If you’re on the fence and you’re not sure, try it for months, try it for a month, and no harm, no foul. If it 
works, then you’re literally saving yourself thousands. If it doesn’t, then just stop using it.</p>

<p>Anyone that owns a business that takes credit card definitely I’m recommending it to them. It’s definitely 
going to save them a lot of money.</p>

<p>I would totally recommend ECT.</p>

<p>We are so confident you’ll never switch merchant service providers again that we are going to give you a 
free credit card terminal and we will never require you to sign any long term contracts. Join the movement 
to recoup lost profits starting today by saying goodbye to your credit card fees forever. Thanks in advance 
for your business and we promise to provide nothing less than white glove service the whole process 
through. Welcome to EasyPay and goodbye to your profit killing credit card fees.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Visa &amp;amp; Mastercard Rate Hike</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/09/01/unfair-rate-hike.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Visa &amp;amp; Mastercard Rate Hike" /><published>2022-09-01T15:01:53-07:00</published><updated>2022-09-01T15:01:53-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/09/01/unfair-rate-hike</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/09/01/unfair-rate-hike.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="visa--mastercard-may-have-raised-your-fees">VISA &amp; MASTERCARD may have RAISED YOUR FEES</h2>

<p>There was a major Visa/Mastercard rate hike that affected restaurants, bars, cafes, retail, services etc. In response, a class-action suit was filed against the major card brands and settlement payouts are available to all the merchants affected…</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of the lawsiut, courtesy of <a href="https://www.natso.com/topics/guidance-on-visa-mastercard-swipe-fee-class-action-settlement">natso.com:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Federal Court has preliminarily approved a proposed settlement of a maximum of approximately $6.24 billion and a minimum of at least $5.54 billion in a class action lawsuit, called In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, MDL 1720 (MKB) (JO). The lawsuit is about claims that merchants paid excessive fees to accept Visa and Mastercard cards because Visa and Mastercard, individually, and together with their respective member banks, violated the antitrust laws. A number of NATSO members who may be a part of this class have sought guidance as to how this process will proceed and what steps they should take as part of this process. 
<br /> <br /></p>

  <p>Following preliminary approval, merchants will receive official notice of the settlement and will need to decide whether they want to:  (1) receive funds from the class settlement; (2) opt out of the settlement completely; or (3) object to the terms of the settlement in order to try to convince the court to reject it.  Each option has its own pros and cons, and merchants may want to consult with their own counsel before making any final decisions. Although all companies should consult counsel before proceeding, as a general matter companies that do not plan to file their own independent lawsuit going forward have decided that it makes the most sense to accept the settlement money associated with this litigation.</p>

<p><strong>If you have Accepted Visa or Mastercard since 2004, you may be getting ripped off without even knowing it.</strong></p>

It was created by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standards were first introduced in 2004 and they have been updated several times since then.</p>

<p>The standards are designed to protect credit card information from being stolen by hackers. They are also designed to ensure that credit card information is not accidentally leaked by businesses.</p>

<p>The standards cover several different areas including:</p>

<ul class="checked-list">
  <li>Network security: This includes firewalls, encryption, and network segmentation.</li>
  <li>Access control: This includes password protection and multifactor authentication.</li>
  <li>Application security: This includes secure coding practices and vulnerability management.</li>
  <li>Physical security: This includes the use of locks, cameras, and alarm systems.</li>
  <li>Business continuity: This includes disaster recovery plans and backup systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance with the standards is voluntary, but it is highly recommended by the PCI Security Standards Council. It is also required by most major credit card companies.</p>

<p>If you fail to comply with the standards, you could be fined or even lose your ability to accept credit cards.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-responsible-for-pci-compliance">Who is responsible for pci compliance?</h4>

<p>Merchants and service providers that process credit card payments are required to comply with these standards.</p>

<p>Merchants and service providers that process credit card payments are not required to comply with PCI compliance if they have less than 10,000 transactions per year.</p>

<h4 id="who-enforces-pci-compliance">Who enforces pci compliance?</h4>

<p>PCI compliance was created by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.</p>

<p>The council was formed in 2006 by the major credit card companies, including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc.</p>

<p>The council’s goal is to reduce credit card fraud by creating a set of security standards for merchants and service providers that process credit card payments.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pci-compliance">How long does it take to get PCI compliance?</h4>

<p>From start to finish, the process of becoming PCI compliant typically takes between a day and two weeks. The actual time for compliance will be dependent on how long the self-assessment questionnaire takes to complete.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-you-get-a-pci-compliance-certificate">How do you get a PCI compliance certificate?</h4>

<p>Step 1: Identify all of the payment card information that is stored on your company’s computers. This includes credit card numbers, credit card security codes, and credit card expiration dates.</p>

<p>Step 2: Determine if your company’s computers are secure from hackers and other threats.</p>

<p>Step 3: If your company’s computers are not secure from hackers and other threats, make sure that they are secure before the next step is taken.</p>

<p>Step 4: Make sure that all of your employees are aware of the rules and regulations of the payment card industry.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[PCI compliance is a set of security standards that are used to protect credit card information.
