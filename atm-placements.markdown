## Free ATM Placements Program

Free ATM placement is for high traffic locations looking for a turnkey solution. Secure Pay Service will carry out the details required to maintain a reliable and profitable ATM machine. With free ATM placement, the establishment does not pay for the ATM machine, delivery fee, installation cost, or repair and maintenance services. We will load the cash in your ATM and monitor it remotely to ensure there is always plenty of cash available for your customers. the location will need to provide ATM signage ($50.00) and we will provide paper supplies. There is no cost to you. The establishment in turn receives a comisssion on each surcharged withdrawal.
