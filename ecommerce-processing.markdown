## E-commerce processing

In 2020, global e-commerce sales reached **US$3.914 trillion.** With big players like Amazon and Alibaba entering the market, competition is fierce and margins are tight. Amazon owns 39% of US e-commerce sales and Alibaba owns 58.2% of e-commerce sales in China.

This is exactly why e-commerce credit card processing is so important for online business owners. As experts point out, it is difficult to make money in e-commerce. Smaller retailers need to play their cards right in the online marketplace to compete with "bigger fish" like Amazon. It starts with protecting your bottom line and choosing the right credit card processor.

### How does credit card processing work in e-commerce?

Many businesses set up merchant accounts for e-commerce credit card processing. This is a type of bank account that accepts online payments. You must apply for a merchant account with your bank or payment company, and Secure Pay Service provides this.

Most merchant account providers accept credit and debit cards. It also supports most card networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express. Fees typically include:

* application fee
* setup fee
* minimum monthly fee
* transaction fee
* chargeback fee
* cancellation fee if canceled

In short, it can get expensive.

In addition, merchant accounts use payment gateways (services that connect e-commerce stores to payment processors). This ensures a secure financial network for our customers. The payment gateway validates the card, identifies the customer's issuing bank, encrypts the number, and approves (or rejects) the transaction.

Secure Pay Service's e-commerce credit card processing streamlines your operations by:

* **Removing the need for an individual merchant account:** Third-party e-commerce credit card processing uses one merchant account to represent different merchants.
* **Removing the need to set up a payment gateway:** Our service includes this. 
* **Provide you with a virtual terminal and point-of-sale system:** This allows you to do things like track inventory and print financial records for tax purposes.

### Why should you consider Secure Pay Service for your e-commerce credit card processing?

Credit cards are the most popular payment option, beating out debit cards and PayPal. Furthermore, customers who do use a credit card tend to spend more. 

As an online merchant, lowering your e-commerce credit card processing fees is crucial to greater success. 

Consider this example: 

* Your e-commerce store achieves $1 million in revenue, with 75% ($750,000) coming from credit card purchases. 
* On that $1 million in revenue, your net margin is 10%. You have $100,000 in profits. 
* However, you pay an average of 3.4% per card transaction in processing fees. On $750,000 in purchases, that equates to $26,250 per year.
