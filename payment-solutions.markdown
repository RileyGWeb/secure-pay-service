### Basic payment processing features:

* Payment device—If you’re not using an integrated POS system, your processor can provide you with a number of credit card terminals to choose from.
* Payment software—The software or API (application programming interface) in your terminal or POS system enables you to connect to a payment processor’s network for transaction processing.
* Data security—Transactions communicate sensitive cardholder information that needs to be protected from data thieves throughout the process.
* Real-time reports—Having visibility into your real-time transaction history can help eliminate errors and prevent unnecessary chargebacks.
* Payment gateway—Some processors have a direct connection to the authorization network. Others connect to a payment gateway to access the network.
* Transactions—Making credit/debit/gift card transactions is the main purpose of a payment processor, so make sure yours has consistent up-time.
* ACH transfers—Your payment processor is integral in the movement of funds from the cardholder’s account to your business’ bank account.
