## Restaurant POS systems with a buffet of benefits to you and your diners.

When you partner with Secure Pay Service for your restaurant merchant account, you will be able to offer your customers better service, simplify back-office tasks, and grow your business by:

Streamline your business operations. Your everyday to-do list of scheduling staff, changing menus, and tracking inventory will be simplified using our proprietary tools.
Serve your customers more quickly. Fewer accounting errors, pay-at-table technology, and interactive menus mean that you can turn tables more quickly and efficiently so your staff can serve more diners.
Smarter server stations. Your servers will be more productive and have more counter space with our low-profile, spill-proof, and durable stations that are user-friendly and install quickly.
Boost diner loyalty. We’ll help your restaurant get up and running with stored value and flexible gift card options that will help attract new customers and keep diners loyal.
Simplify end-of-night accounting tasks. You and your staff won’t have to bother with tallying credit card receipts separately from the cash drawer, since all your payment processing is in one location with our specialized restaurant POS solution.
