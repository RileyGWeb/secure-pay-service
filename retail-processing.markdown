## Retail Processing

Do you own a retail business ? Our retail credit card processing solutions can help you get paid faster while saving you between 20% and 60% on your retail payment processing rates every month. This type of Retail Merchant Account is commonly called in the industry as a Swiped Merchant Account or Card Present Merchant Account. It is most common in retail industries such as restaurants, clothing stores, boutiques, flower shops, electronic shops, Auto Parts Stores, etc.,..However, it is also used by many service-based businesses.

A Retail Merchant Account allow merchants to accept all major credit cards, debit cards and ACH/Echecks. This type of Merchant Account is best for merchants who process most of their credit card transactions with the customer present at the time of sale. Since the customer’s credit card is present at the time of the sale, the chances of the sale turning out fraudulent are far less. As a result of the card transaction being less risky, the retail payment processing transaction will offer retail businesses much lower retail credit card processing rates. The savings can be significantly less compared to card not present transactions. The Retail sales transactions can be done as a “swipe” or “contactless” transactions (Also known as NFC).

A Retail Merchant Account from Secure Pay Service will provide next-day funding and the highest PCI security on every Retail Credit Card Transaction you make at your retail shop. Plus, you will enjoy all our technology solutions such as EMV Retail Credit Card Terminals, Point of Sale Equipment and other POS systems that will take the struggle out of payments.
