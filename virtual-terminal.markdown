## Friction-free payments, on demand

Frictionless enterprise payments require an on-demand attitude. That means any payment— anyway. It also means anywhere—whether you’re accepting payments in-store, online, across channels or through enterprise resource planning systems for any B2B or B2C customer. They also should help you maximize acceptance and revenue, every step of the way. That includes all kinds of payments, including alternatives, across systems and borders.
